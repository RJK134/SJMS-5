## Review Scope — SJMS 2.5

> ⚠️ Review only the diff in this PR and the control files it updates.

**BLOCKING findings ONLY if they affect:**
1. Authentication, authorisation, or data scoping correctness
2. Missing validation, audit logging, or webhook emission on touched mutations
3. Hard deletes or destructive finance/marks retention behaviour
4. Broken CI, build, verification, or release-discipline automation
5. Broken routes, portal entry points, or workflow/event regressions introduced by this PR
6. Security-critical configuration drift (secrets, CSP/CORS, auth bypass, request correlation, workflow credentials)

**NON-BLOCKING findings:**
- repository-layer bypasses
- missing tests where the diff introduces logic
- documentation drift outside the touched files
- style or naming issues directly in the diff
- backlog-worthy concerns that do not block merge

**DO NOT:**
- request broad refactors outside this PR's scope
- reopen already-accepted architectural decisions unless this PR regresses them
- comment on untouched files
- suggest new frameworks or dependencies unless required to fix a blocking issue

**OUTPUT LIMITS:**
- Maximum 5 blocking findings
- Maximum 5 non-blocking findings
- State `BLOCKING` or `NON-BLOCKING` on every finding
- State `must fix before merge`, `fix if quick`, or `backlog` on every finding

## Acceptance gates

Hard gates (must pass before merge):

- [ ] `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] `cd client && npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL=... npx prisma validate --schema=prisma/schema.prisma`
- [ ] `npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema.prisma`
- [ ] Relevant Vitest suites pass (server `cd server && npm run test`)
- [ ] Relevant Playwright suites pass (when user journeys are touched)
- [ ] `docs/VERIFICATION-PROTOCOL.md` gates reviewed
- [ ] BugBot HIGH findings: 0 open
- [ ] GitGuardian / secret checks: no blocking findings
- [ ] No `.claude/worktrees/`, `.claude/*.txt`, `*.log`, or other agent-session artefacts in the diff
- [ ] No new gitlink (mode 160000) entry without a matching `.gitmodules` record (`git ls-files -s | awk '$1=="160000"'` empty)

Reports (non-blocking, surfaced for visibility):

- [ ] CI step `Publish server coverage summary` rendered without errors. Coverage thresholds inherit from `server/vitest.config.ts`; the CI workflow does not override them. See the ratchet plan in `docs/BUILD-QUEUE.md`.

List the exact commands run and their outcomes. For CI-only changes,
point at the CI run URL and, where relevant, the coverage artefact
published from the `server-coverage` upload step.
