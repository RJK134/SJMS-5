# SJMS 2.5 — Consolidated Comparative Deep Review

**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Branch:** `claude/review-sjms-2.5-5B5KA`
**Base commit:** `f23d1a1` (Phase 13 truth table merged to main)
**Method:** Multi-agent evidence-based exploration of repository artefacts — code, schema, routers, pages, tests, workflows, docs — cross-checked against existing self-assessment artefacts in `docs/review/`.

This review answers 18 dimensions set by the requester. It is structured in four companion files:

| File | Scope |
|------|-------|
| `00-executive-summary.md` (this file) | Verdict, maturity dial, headline numbers |
| `01-system-review.md` | Dimensions 1–12: purpose, features, architecture, stack, data, auth, UX, testing, deployment, code quality, security, docs |
| `02-debt-risk-lineage.md` | Dimensions 13–15: technical debt, strengths/weaknesses/risks/maturity, evolutionary lineage |
| `03-benchmark-and-remediation.md` | Dimensions 16–18: HE reference model benchmark, commercial SIS comparison, design and remediation plan |

## Verdict in one paragraph

SJMS 2.5 is an **architecturally disciplined, infrastructure-complete, business-logic-thin** UK HE student-journey platform. Its strengths are a 197-model Prisma schema aligned to Tribal SITS concepts and HESA Data Futures, a fully decomposed 44-router Express API backed by a consistent router → controller → service → repository pattern, Keycloak 24 OIDC with 36 RBAC roles, Redis-backed rate limiting, dual-mode TLS, Prometheus metrics, and a 129-page React 18 client across four portals. Its defining weakness is that **~40 of the 44 domain services are CRUD shells** with no business rules (no mark aggregation, no grade boundary application, no progression/classification calculation, no fee engine, no HESA XML export, no UKVI alert automation, no timetable clash detection, no file-content upload pipeline). Test coverage is 10 of 44 services (23%), E2E is smoke-only (3 specs). The repository's own Phase 13 review scores it **3.8/10 overall — 8/10 on platform infrastructure, 1.5/10 on business application** — and this review concurs. The correct descriptor is **"enterprise scaffold, not enterprise product"**: suitable as a controlled pilot base for a small UK HE provider after a 6–9 month business-logic programme, **not** a replacement candidate for Tribal SITS, Ellucian Banner or Workday Student on any realistic 2026–2027 horizon.

## Headline risks

1. **Business logic vacuum** — the system cannot compute a module result, a degree classification, a tuition invoice, a HESA Data Futures payload or a UKVI non-engagement alert today. Every "domain" service is a thin Prisma wrapper with Zod validation plus audit + webhook emission.
2. **HESA unimplementable without mapping** — `HESAReturn`, `HESAStudent`, `HESAStudentModule`, `HESAValidationRule` models exist; no mapper, no validation executor, no XML/JSON export, no submission client.
3. **Finance cascade hazard** — Invoice→StudentAccount and ChargeLine→Invoice relations use `onDelete: Cascade`; UK HE finance audit requires `Restrict`. Breaking SOX-equivalent audit guarantees if any parent row is deleted.
4. **Auth realm drift** — `auth.ts` defaults to realm `fhe` while `.env.example` and the Keycloak import file reference `sjms`/`fhe` inconsistently. Will produce silent 401s on first production deploy if not reconciled.
5. **n8n workflows all inactive** — 15 JSON files are version-controlled but `"active": false`. The webhook event channel is real but the downstream automations are not armed.
6. **No CI/CD** — merges to `main` have no automated typecheck/test gate. Phase-12 scepticism ("fabricated business logic files") was only caught by a post-hoc truth-table audit. This is a governance, not a code, gap but it is the single highest-leverage fix.
7. **Duplicate untracked migrations** — two identically-named `extend_support_category` migration directories, 46 seconds apart. Indicates a developer-side collision that was not cleaned up before the Phase 13 baseline.
8. **Commercial SIS competitive gap** — the product does not enter the consideration set for Tribal SITS, Ellucian Banner or Workday Student replacements. See `03-benchmark-and-remediation.md` for a feature-by-feature matrix.

## Headline strengths

1. **Architectural discipline is real.** The router/controller/service/repository layering is applied with 100% consistency across 44 domains. Nothing in `server/src/api/` bypasses the pattern. Very few self-built systems of this size maintain that level of structural integrity.
2. **Data model is HE-literate.** 197 models, 23 domains, HESA DF snapshotting, UKVI attendance monitoring, EC claims + appeals, graduation/award chains, accommodation, placements, governance committees, academic calendar — the coverage is wide and the nomenclature is correct. An experienced UK registrar would recognise the schema.
3. **Security posture is above HE-sector median.** Helmet + CORS allow-list + Redis-backed 3-tier rate limiting + timing-safe internal-service-key comparison + JWKS with rate-limited refresh + memory-only tokens on the client + 90%-coverage audit log. This is materially better than many legacy campus Banner/SITS deployments.
4. **Self-awareness is unusual and valuable.** The repo contains `docs/review/00-executive-verdict.md`, `phase-13-enhanced-review.md`, `phase-13-truth-table.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — an honest, grep-verifiable paper trail. The project does not misrepresent itself.
5. **British-English compliance and FHE design tokens** are applied throughout (enrolment, programme, colour, organisation, centre) — a small thing that matters to a UK HE audience and differentiates it from Americanised forks of the same source.
6. **Operational runbooks exist.** `OPERATIONS-SSL-RUNBOOK.md`, `STAGING-RUNBOOK.md`, dual-mode TLS (Let's Encrypt / institutional CA), nginx hardening, Prometheus metrics, `/api/health` with a live DB probe. Day-2 ops thinking is already present.
